## Every Session

1. Read `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`; `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; main session also `MEMORY.md`. Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Memory

Daily: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Long-term: `MEMORY.md` (main session only). Text > Brain.

## Safety

No exfiltration of private data. No destructive commands without asking. In group chats, participate — don't dominate.

## Tools

Skills provide your tools. Local notes in `TOOLS.md`.

# HEARTBEAT.md

Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to reply HEARTBEAT_OK and skip real work on each heartbeat.

When you want the assistant to do something periodically, add a short checklist below. The agent will read this on each heartbeat and run through it. Keep the list small to limit token use.

## Example (customize or remove)

- Check calendar: any events in the next 24h that need a reminder or prep?
- Check inbox (if tool available): any urgent or high-priority unread?
- Optional: any follow-up from recent memory/ that the user might have forgotten?

Respect quiet hours (see USER.md or TOOLS.md). If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

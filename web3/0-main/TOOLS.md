# TOOLS.md - Local Notes (Web3 场景)

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to this workspace and this user.

## What Goes Here

Environment- and user-specific details, for example:

- **Calendar:** Account names, which calendar for work vs personal, default reminder lead time
- **Contacts / nicknames:** How to refer to people or systems (e.g. "PM" = product manager)
- **Reminders:** Default timing (e.g. 15 min before meetings), quiet hours, preferred channel
- **Communication:** Preferred TTS voice, default email account, how they like links formatted (e.g. Discord wrap in `<>` to suppress embeds)
- **Paths:** Any project or document roots they often refer to (only if they've told you)
- **SSH / hosts:** Server aliases, usernames (if you have tools that use them)
- **Other:** Device names, room names, anything that helps you assist without asking again

## Examples

```markdown
### Calendar

- Primary: work (Google)
- Default reminder: 15 min before
- Don't remind between 22:00–08:00 local

### Contacts

- PM → Product lead, prefers short updates

### TTS / Voice

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, clear)
- Use for: summaries, storytime, long reads

### Formatting

- Discord: no markdown tables; use bullets; wrap links in <> to avoid embeds
- WhatsApp: no headers; use **bold** for emphasis
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared and updated. Your setup is yours. Keeping local notes here means you can update skills without losing user-specific details, and share skills without leaking personal or environment info.

Add whatever helps in this Web3 context (e.g. chain IDs, project nicknames, alert preferences). Do not put keys or wallet details here. This is your cheat sheet.

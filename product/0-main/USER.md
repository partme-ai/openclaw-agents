## Context

What do they care about? What are they working on? What annoys them or what do they prefer (e.g. short vs detailed replies, tone)? Build this over time from conversation and behavior.

## Communication Preferences

- **Length:** Prefer short answers or more detail?
- **Channels:** Where do they talk to you (web, WhatsApp, etc.) and any format rules (e.g. no big tables on mobile)?
- **Proactivity:** How much unsolicited nudging is welcome (reminders, “you have a meeting in 1h”, etc.)?

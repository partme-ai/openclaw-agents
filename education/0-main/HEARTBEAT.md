When you want periodic checks, add a short checklist below. Keep it small to limit token use.

## Example (customize or remove)

- Check calendar: any classes or deadlines in the next 24h that need a reminder or prep?
- Optional: any follow-up from recent memory/ that the user might have forgotten?

Respect quiet hours (USER.md or TOOLS.md). If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

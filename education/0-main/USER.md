## Context

What do they care about? Which classes or groups do they work with? What tone do they prefer (formal vs casual)? Any compliance or school policies to keep in mind? Build this over time.

## Communication Preferences

- **Length:** Prefer short answers or more detail?
- **Channels:** Where do they talk to you (web, WhatsApp, etc.) and any format rules (e.g. no big tables on mobile)?
- **Proactivity:** How much unsolicited nudging is welcome (reminders, “you have a meeting in 1h”, etc.)?

The more you know, the better you can help. Update this file as you learn. Respect privacy — you’re learning about a person to assist them, not to build a dossier.

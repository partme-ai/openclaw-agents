# TOOLS.md - Local Notes (教育场景)

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics in this education workspace.

## What Goes Here

- **Calendar:** Which calendar(s) for classes, deadlines, parent meetings; default reminder lead time; quiet hours (e.g. no reminders after 21:00 for families).
- **Classes / groups:** Short names or IDs (e.g. "Grade 5A", "Math Club") so you can refer to them consistently.
- **Contacts:** How to refer to roles (e.g. "homeroom", "PE teacher") or nicknames the user has approved.
- **Drafting:** Preferred tone for announcements vs feedback; any templates or phrases the user likes.
- **Channels:** Where the user talks to you (web, WeChat, etc.) and format rules (e.g. no large tables on mobile).
- **Paths:** Any curriculum or document roots the user has pointed you to.

## Examples

```markdown
### Calendar

- Primary: school Google calendar

### Classes

- 5A → Grade 5 Class A, homeroom Ms. Li
- Math Club → Wed 16:00, room 302

### Tone

- Announcements: neutral, clear, one short paragraph

```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Local notes stay here so you can update skills without losing context and without leaking personal or student info.
